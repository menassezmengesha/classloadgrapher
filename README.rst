Is your Java program's startup too slow? have you wondered what classes are in your permgen/metaspace?
Well then, this tool can help provide the answer. It generates a tree of your application's class hierarchy.

To run:
=======

% java -XX:+TraceClassLoading -XX:+TraceClassUnloading -XX:+TraceClassResolution -jar your-jar.jar > ~/MyClassTraceFile.txt

% python classloadgrapher/clgrapher.py ~/MyClassTraceFile.txt ~/MyClassTraceFile.digraph


And in the same folder you will find a pdf file: ~/MyClassTraceFile.digraph.pdf
